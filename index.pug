At best you can get the golden crate which gives you an unbound accessory piece to sell! At worst, you get a toothpick which still pretty much is bought for slightly above the cost you spent on the ticket. Note you should do this after you are working on the Manticore nest. Always use runs to benefit yourself before earning Dragon Coins.

              td Upgrading Manticore equipment with Manticore items has been underrated. While the upgrade is not permanent (it will not transfer to the next tier), it gives stats equal to 2 or 3 enhances, for a lower cost. As such, if you are chasing BP for the level 40 content and for harder cerberus hell modes, it is a good option. Of course, this is not a priority if you don't wish to rush to the top as F2P; you can always wait for the materials themselves to lower in price, and buying Agates remain one of the more consistent and permanent ways of upgrading your character.

              td Guild sign-ins are an underestimated way of obtaining Battle Medals faster. Typically if world boss medals stay low it isn't very high priority, but as people are beginning to snipe medals away, it becomes apparent to use contribution to buy battle medals as frequently as you can. After Moniker V Guild Sign In is less efficient however.
